# polygenic_scores

Script I used as part of a paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006322322014056) to create polygenic scores.

Here, we used a subset of UK Biobank (UKB) data for the discovery sample GWAS and applied those scores to a separate subset of UKB. 

We used a "densely phenotyped" sample to predict a "sparsely phenotyped" sample and vice versa.

The phenotype of interest was a factor score of Common Executive Function.
